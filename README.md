Zero-Knowledge proofs are coming to Ethereum and Dapps in 2019!

EthSnarks is a collection of zkSNARK circuits and supporting libraries to use them with Ethereum smart contracts, it aims to help solve one of the biggest problems facing zkSNARKS on Ethereum - cross-platform on desktop, mobile and in-browser, cheap enough to run on-chain, and with algorithms that significantly reduces the time it takes to run the prover.

The notable advantages of using EthSnarks are:

 * Reduced cost, 500k gas with 1 input, using [Groth16](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/260.pdf).
 * Prove zkSNARKs in-browser, with WebAssembly and Emscripten
 * Linux, Mac and Windows builds
 * Solidity, Python and C++ support in one place
 * A growing library of gadgets and algorithms

EthSnarks is participating in the Ethereum Foundation's grants program, development will continue full-time and we will be working with companies and developers to help overcome the common challenges and hurdles that we all face. Get in-touch for more information.

**WARNING: EthSnarks is beta quality software, improvements and fixes are made frequently, and documentation doesn't yet exist**

## Building

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HarryR/ethsnarks.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HarryR/ethsnarks) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/yk08x7xtk9te10vo/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/harryr/ethsnarks/branch/master)

### Unix Flavours (Linux, OSX, Ubuntu, CentOS etc.)

The following dependencies are required to build Ethsnarks:

 * cmake
 * g++ or clang++
 * gmp
 * npm / nvm

Check-out the source-code using:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:HarryR/ethsnarks.git && cd ethsnarks
```

After checking-out the repository you need to install the necessary dependencies, the `Makefile` includes pre-determined rules for different platforms:

 * `make fedora-dependencies` (CentOS, Fedora, RHEL etc. requires `dnf`)
 * `make ubuntu-dependencies` (Ubuntu, Debian etc.)
 * `make mac-dependencies` (OSX, requires [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/))

Then install the Python dependencies, via Pip, into the local user directory:

 * `make python-dependencies`

Then build and test the project:

 * `make`

### Windows (64-bit)

Install MSYS2 from https://www.msys2.org/ then open the MSYS2 Shell and run:

```bash
pacman --noconfirm -S make gmp gmp-devel gcc git cmake
git clone git@github.com:HarryR/ethsnarks.git
cd ethsnarks
cmake -E make_directory build
cmake -E chdir build cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
cmake --build build
```

Building under 32-bit MinGW32, MSYS (not MSYS2) and Microsoft Visual Studio may be supported in future depending upon demand, but currently are probably broken.

### WASM / Browser

WebAssembly, WASM and JavaScript builds are partially supported via [ethsnarks-emscripten](https://github.com/harryr/ethsnarks-emscripten) and [ethsnarks-cheerp](https://github.com/Ethsnarks/ethsnarks-cheerp). The build process is more complex...

# Requests and Contributions

This project aims to help create an ecosystem where a small number of well tested but simple zkSNARK circuits can be easily integrated into your project without having to do all of the work up-front.

If you have any ideas for new components, please [Open an issue](https://github.com/HarryR/ethsnarks/issues/new), or submit a pull request.

# Gadgets

We are surely increasing the range of gadgets, supporting libraries, available documentation and examples; at the moment the best way to find out how to use something is to dig into the code or ask questions via a [new issue](https://github.com/HarryR/ethsnarks/issues/new?labels=question,help%20wanted)

The following gadgets are available

 * 1-of-N
 * [2-bit lookup table](src/gadgets/lookup_2bit.cpp)
 * [3-bit lookup table](src/gadgets/lookup_3bit.cpp)
 * [MiMC](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/492) hash and cipher
 * [Poseidon](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/458.pdf) hash function
 * [Miyaguchi-Preneel one-way function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_compression_function)
 * Merkle tree
 * SHA256 (Ethereum compatible, full round)
 * [Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing)
 * 'Baby JubJub' twisted Edwards curve
   * EdDSA
   * Pedersen hash
